### Hey there! 👋

I'm an indie iOS developer and the author of [Ortho – Perspective Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ortho-perspective-camera/id1419668775), a camera app that helps you compose photos with perfect perspectives.

I'm also a WWDC 2019 Scholarship winner. Had a lovely trip to San Jose.

## Featured Repos

📳 [Motif](https://github.com/weihengpan/Motif): Easily record, view, and export motion data on iOS.

## Links

📖 I own a [personal blog](https://blog.weiheng.me) in Chinese where I keep my photos and write about travels, maths, and emotional moments. The update frequency is hardly predictable, though.

I don't post content on third-party websites.

## Trivia

🏓️ I play table tennis at an intermediate level.

🎵 I play the harmonica. City pop and jazz are my favorites.

🎮 I'm a Nintendo fan and RTS player.
